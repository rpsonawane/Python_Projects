The Virtual Dressing Room project is a Python application that uses computer vision and pose detection to overlay virtual shirts on a live webcam feed in real-time. Leveraging OpenCV and cvzone's PoseDetector, it accurately positions shirts based on body landmarks and allows users to switch shirts with gestures, offering an amazing experience.
